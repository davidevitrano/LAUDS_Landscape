                <h2>About the project</h2>

                <p class="abstract">An experimental web interface that provides an up-to-date definition and deeper
                    insights into sustainable urban manufacturing in Europe. By exploring a network map and its various
                    visualizations, users will be able to discover the values, materials, processes, and images that
                    reflect and connect the realities and actors in the field.</p>

                <p>The data collection and analysis process was conducted through a structured approach combining desk research, visual exploration, and qualitative interviews. Data was gathered starting with an in-depth analysis of actors and projects related to sustainable urban production in Europe, identified through social media, platforms, events, and fairs. Each actor was cataloged with descriptions, keywords, hashtags, and visual content sourced from their official channels, creating an organized and detailed dataset. This dataset was enriched with interactive visualizations, including nodes and maps, enabling the analysis of connections and patterns among actors and concepts. Interviews validated the collected data and provided qualitative perspectives to complete the picture. Finally, the data was structured into formats compatible with the design of an interactive interface, ensuring transparency and accessibility for researchers, producers, and the general public interested in the topic.
